          <h1>Mei Bai</h1>
          <h2>Artist + Graphic Designer </h2>

          <p>As a traditional artist, my careful observation and understanding of nature led me to the artistic path of expressing natural scenery. And it drives me to keep innovating. God has endowed nature with rich colors, which is very important to me. It gives me space to create, which is what I pursue in innovation. I hope that viewers can dig out their own emotions while enjoying the beauty of my work. In the process of exploring the innovation of painting, Mei Bai realized that art not only brings people the enjoyment of beauty but also explores the perception and experience of life. It is people's understanding and expression of the world and self-meaning, and the embodiment of social development.</p>
          <p> Mei Bai was influenced by her family and loved painting. After years of understanding, exploring, and describing nature, she fell in love with landscape painting. Mei Bai's works mainly reflect the natural landscape, misty clouds, clear water, rocks, trees, and rivers. This is the characteristic of her painting. Mei Bai's works can bring people a sense of peace and profound, showing poetic pictures. This is an ideal world. In order to innovate, she keeps learning and practicing. The direction of her adjustment is to increase the visual effect of color, expand the sense of space and enrich the plot of the characters. This can bring people new feelings. 
            Art has become the most important part of  Mei Bai's life,  and it also makes her realize her value. She hopes to create more and better works and let more people know about traditional Chinese landscape painting and should embody the thought of modern humanistic art in the form of Oriental Art. Mei Bai hopes that her works not only bring pleasure to the audience but also make them feel a lot of Philosophy in life.</p>
